(* The northerners are attacking Middlebirch. As the archwizard you know the sequence
 of spells needed to protect Middlebirch. The sequence of spells is written as a list
 [("name1", value1); ("name2", value2); ...].
 At your disposal is a band of wizards, who are represented as a list
 [("name1", ability1); ("name2", ability2); ...].
 A wizard can cast the sequence of spells only if his ability is greater or equal to
 the combined value of all spells in the sequence.

 The function "able_protectors spells wizards" returns a list of names of all the
 wizards able to protect Middlebirch on their own.

 The function "fails_on spells wizards" returns a list of pairs (wizard, failed spell),
 where the failed spell is the first spell in the sequence for which the wizard has 
 insufficient ability. The ability to cast all spells is represented as an empty string 
 for the failed spell.
 
 Hint: A good wizard uses his knowledge and experiences gained during his studies.
